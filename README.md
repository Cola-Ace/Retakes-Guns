# Retakes-Guns
It works only in CS:GO.
## Plugin function:
1. You can choose the pistol in the round and the pistol in the whole round
2. There is a chance that one side of the game will be forced up (i.e. all submachine guns)
3. Submachine gun and jet can be used when forced up (excluding M249 and Negev)
4. In the pistol game, if the player chooses the default pistol, he will take half armour, otherwise he will not
5. Players will randomly own 1-2 props at the beginning of the game
6. The gun selection menu will display the gun selected by the current player

If the plugin has bugs or has some interesting features, I will keep updating the plug-in.
